Our project is a medical chatbot that helps users ask medical-related questions and get useful answers powered by a large language model (LLM). The chatbot works by searching through a medical textbook that we have processed and stored in a vector database. When a user asks a question, the system finds the most relevant text from the book and sends that, along with the question, to the LLM, which then gives a clear and short answer. The main goal is not to give real medical advice, but to show how cloud computing, vector databases, and AI models can work together to build something practical and educational.
